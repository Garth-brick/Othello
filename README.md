# Othello
Just a simple two-player Othello game with classical rules (currently working on one-player mode).
The main file contatins the major chunk of the code.
The board file is just one function to flip the pieces and to check if any pieces are flipped.
The possibilities file is to see which positions on the board have any moves possible.
